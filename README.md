## Setup

If using the Advent of Code Template repo; click [**`Use this template`**](https://github.com/MJGTwo/advent-of-code-nodets-template/generate) and set a new repository name.

Clone this repo, then run `yarn install` to install dependencies.

If this a brand new repository, run: `ts-node setup` to configure it for Current Year and check in the changes.

## Running

To run a solution by day, use:

```bash
yarn start day1
```

If a solution exists for that day, then it will run with basic tests. If a solution does not exist, it will copy the template, and then try to download that day's puzzle input using [AOCD](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data).

If you don't have AOCD configured, populate `input.txt` with your solution input from the AOC website, and then start implementing your solution in the new folder for that day.

Once you have calculated a solution, you should manually submit your answer through the website.
